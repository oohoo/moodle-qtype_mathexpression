### Tutorial 1: Polynomial Simplification

1. Create a quiz within a course
2. Edit the quiz and create a new MathExpression question
3. Name the question:
  <br/>`Polynomial Simplification 1`
4. In the question text put:
  <br/>`Simplify the following polynomial x^2 + 5x + 6`
5. Uncheck all the button groups except for `Operators`, the rest of the buttons are not needed to answer
this question. Feel free to play with these and notice how the editor below in the answers section changes.
6. Set Compare Type to `Full` (we need this because there are some excluded expressions we need to take care of)
7. Within the answer box add `(x+3)(x+2)` and set the grade to `100%`
8. Add a variable `x`
9. Add an excluded expression `x^2 + 5x + 6`. This prevents the student from submitting `x^2 + 5x + 6` as an
answer to the question.

### Tutorial 2: Polynomial Simplification

1. Create a quiz within a course
2. Edit the quiz and create a new MathExpression question
3. Name the question:
  <br/>`Gravitational Potential Energy Equation`
4. In the question text put:
  <br/>`What is the gravitational potential energy equation? (\Delta U)`
5. Uncheck all the button groups except for `Operators`, the rest of the buttons are not needed to answer
this question. Feel free to play with these and notice how the editor below in the answers section changes.
6. Set Compare Type to `Simple`
7. Within the answer box add `mgh` and set the grade to `100%`
8. Add a variable for each `m`, `g` and `h`
